# Learning Driven DBMS survey :rocket:
### This repository accompanies the survey “Learning-Driven Database Systems: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Outlook”, aiming to systematically organize the rapidly growing research at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and data management systems.

## Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with:
1. A structured paper list
2. Research topic classification
3. Public datasets & benchmarks
4. Practical codebases
5. Up-to-date trends and open challenges

### :computer:Papers and codes are as follows, we divided them into four categories:

## :book:1. surveys
 1. `['SGMD '2016]` Database Meets Deep Learning: Challenges and Opportunities [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08986)], [[Code](无)]



## :robot:2. Machine-Learning based methods
