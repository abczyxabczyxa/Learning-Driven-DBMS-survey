# Learning Driven DBMS survey :rocket:
### This repository accompanies the survey ¡°Learning-Driven Database Systems: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Outlook¡±, aiming to systematically organize the rapidly growing research at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and data management systems.

## The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with:
? A structured paper list
? Research topic classification
? Public datasets & benchmarks
? Practical codebases
? Up-to-date trends and open challenges

### :computer:papers and codes are as follows, we divided them into three categories:

## :book:1. surveys





## :robot:2. machine-learning based methods
 1. `['Distributed and parallel databases '2018]` Scalable Machine Learning Computing a Data Summarization Matrix with a Parallel Array DBMS [[PDF](https://www2.cs.uh.edu/~ordonez/pdfwww/w-2019-DAPD-gammacloud.pdf)], [[Code](ÎÞ)]
 2. `['Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science '2024]` Machine learning approach for intrusion detection system using dimensionality reduction [[PDF](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/6ef52f321b5c2e850678af7c2246c55ae55e597e)], [[Code](ÎÞ)]


## :printer:3. deep-learning based methods





## :fire:4. datasets and benchmarks
